Tuples, Dictionaries & sets.
Used the correct data structures to store data. 

Creating TUPLES: 
Example: 
This list has movies like Vertigo and release dates like 1958 but is not clear
which data belongs to which movies.

We can group related pieces of data with a tuple like in movie_tuples here, which group movie names and release dates together.

Movies = ["Vertigo", "Parasite", 1958, 2019]
movie_tuples = [("Vertigo", 1958), ("Parasite,2019)]
vertigo_data = ("Vertigo",1958)
print(vertigo_data)
